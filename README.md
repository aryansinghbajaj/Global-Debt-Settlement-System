# <span style="font-size: 36px; color: #2c3e50;">Global Debt Settlement System</span>

<p style="font-size: 18px; color: #34495e;">
The <strong>Global Debt Settlement System</strong> is a Java-based application designed to optimize financial transactions among nations with varying payment modes. By leveraging a central mediator (like the United Nations), it ensures efficient debt settlement even when nations do not share a common payment mode.

## <span style="font-size: 28px; color: #2980b9;">Features</span>

<ul style="font-size: 16px; color: #2c3e50;">
    <li><strong>Debt Minimization</strong>: Reduces the number of transactions needed to settle debts.</li>
    <li><strong>Payment Mode Compatibility</strong>: Considers different payment modes used by each nation.</li>
    <li><strong>Central Mediator</strong>: Facilitates settlements through a central entity when no common payment mode exists.</li>
    <li><strong>Dynamic Input</strong>: Accepts dynamic input for nations, payment modes, and transactions.</li>
    <li><strong>Graph-Based Algorithm</strong>: Uses a graph-based approach for optimal debt settlement.</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-size: 18px; color: #34495e;">
This project utilizes the <strong>graph data structure</strong> to model the complex network of financial transactions between nations. In this system:
</p>
<ul style="font-size: 16px; color: #2c3e50;">
    <li>Each <strong>nation</strong> is represented as a <strong>node</strong>.</li>
    <li>Each <strong>transaction</strong> between nations is an <strong>edge</strong> with an associated weight (transaction amount) and label (payment mode).</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-size: 18px; color: #34495e;">
By applying <strong>graph-based algorithms</strong>, the system efficiently finds the minimal set of transactions needed to settle all debts, demonstrating a practical real-world application of <strong>graph theory</strong>. This approach is invaluable in scenarios involving interconnected entities and complex relationships, such as international finance and logistics.
